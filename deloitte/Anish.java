// Anish is the laziest person you can ever see. He is tasked to write the name of the winner in a game where two people take part.
 //And he just writes the longest
 //common subsequence over there, so that with minimum chane or no backspace he can edit the name to the winnerâ€™s name.
// // For two given names, you have to predict what Anish will write in his computer 
// before the start of the name. If there are more than two longest subsequences possible,write the one with less lexicographic value.
// Input Format:
// Two lines including two strings of name(All with capital letters)

// Output Format:
// A single line with the lexicographically smallest possible longest common subsequence.

// Sample Input:
// ABCD
// BACD
// Sample Output:
// ACD
// Exclamation:
// ACD and BCD these are the two possible biggest substring
